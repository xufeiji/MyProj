And writing device drivers is one of the few areas of programming for the Linux operating system that calls for unique, Linux-specific knowledge. For years now, programmers have relied on the classic Linux Device Drivers from O'Reilly to master this critical subject. Now in its third edition, this bestselling guide provides all the information you'll need to write drivers for a wide range of devices. Over the years the book has helped countless programmers learn:  * how to support computer peripherals under the Linux operating system * how to develop and write software for new hardware under Linux * the basics of Linux operation even if they are not expecting to write a driver The new edition of Linux Device Drivers is better than ever.  The book covers all the significant changes to Version 2.6 of the Linux kernel, which simplifies many activities, and contains subtle new features that can make a driver both more efficient and more flexible. Readers will find new chapters on important types of drivers not covered previously, such as consoles, USB drivers, and more.  Best of all, you don't have to be a kernel hacker to understand and enjoy this book.  All you need is an understanding of the C programming language and some background in Unix system calls.  And for maximum ease-of-use, the book uses full-featured examples that you can compile and run without special hardware. Today Linux holds fast as the most rapidly growing segment of the computer market and continues to win over enthusiastic adherents in many application areas.  With this increasing support, Linux is now absolutely mainstream, and viewed as a solid platform for embedded systems.  If you're writing device drivers, you'll want this book. In fact, you'll wonder how drivers are ever written without it."},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Use the New Body Language to Get What You Want!, the 7-day Plan","pubdate":"2010-02-16","image":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s4253834.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","images":{"small":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/spic\/s4253834.jpg","large":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/lpic\/s4253834.jpg","medium":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s4253834.jpg"},"alt":"http:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4300977\/","id":"4300977","title":"You Say More Than You Think","author_intro":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","price":"USD 25.00","translator":[],"pages":"240","publisher":"Crown","isbn10":"0307453979","isbn13":"9780307453976","alt_title":"","url":"http:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4300977","author":["Janine Driver","Mariska van Aalst"],"summary":"Now You’re Talking! \nDo you want to be bulletproof at work, secure in your relationship, and content in your own skin? If so, it’s more important than ever to be aware of what your body is saying to the outside world. Unfortunately, most of what you’ve heard from other body language experts is wrong, and, as a result, your actions may be hurting, not helping, you. \n\nWith sass and a keen eye, media favorite Janine Driver teaches you the skills she used every day to stay alive during her fifteen years as a body-language expert at the ATF. Janine’s 7-day plan and her 7-second solutions teach you dozens of body language fixes to turn any interpersonal situation to your advantage. She reveals methods here that other experts refuse to share with the public, and she debunks major myths other experts swear are fact:\n \nGiving more eye contact is key when you’re trying to impress someone.  Not necessarily true. It’s actually more important where you point your  belly button . This small body shift communicates true interest more powerfully than constant eye contact.\n\n The “steeple” hand gesture will give you the upper hand during negotiations and business meetings.  Wrong. Driver has seen this overbearing gesture backfire more often than not. Instead, she suggests two  new  steeples that give you power without making you seem overly aggressive: the Basketball Steeple and the A-OK Two-Fingered Steeple. \n \nHappy people command power and attention by smiling just before they meet new people.  Studies have shown that people who do this are viewed as Beta Leaders. Alpha leaders smile once they shake your hand and hear your name.\n\nAt a time when every advantage counts—and first impressions matter more than ever—this is the book to help you really get your message across."},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","pubdate":"1996-03-01","image":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s3802138.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","images":{"small":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/spic\/s3802138.jpg","large":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/lpic\/s3802138.jpg","medium":"http:\/\/img3.douban.com\/mpic\/s3802138.jpg"},"alt":"http:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2401495\/","id":"2401495","title":"Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon","author_intro":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","price":"USD 34.95","translator":[],"pages":"1184","publisher":"Hendrickson Publishers","isbn10":"1565632060","isbn13":"9781565632066","alt_title":"","url":"http:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2401495","author":["Francis Brown","S.

He believed that moral virtue must involve intellectual excellence. To have moral virtue one must have practical wisdom - the ability to deliberate well and to see what is morally relevant in a given context. Julia Driver challenges this classical theory of virtue, arguing that it fails to take into account virtues which do seem to involve ignorance or epistemic defect. Some 'virtues of ignorance' are counterexamples to accounts of virtue which hold that moral virtue must involve practical wisdom. Modesty, for example, is generally considered to be a virtue even though the modest person may be making an inaccurate assessment of his or her accomplishments. Driver argues that we should abandon the highly intellectualist view of virtue and instead adopt a consequentialist perspective which holds that virtue is simply a character trait which systematically produces good consequences."},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","pubdate":"2010-9-21","image":"http:\/\/img5.douban.com\/mpic\/s9026369.jpg","binding":"Paperback","images":{"small":"http:\/\/img5.douban.com\/spic\/s9026369.jpg","large":"http:\/\/img5.douban.com\/lpic\/s9026369.jpg","medium":"http:\/\/img5.douban.com\/mpic\/s9026369.jpg"},"alt":"http:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10583741\/","id":"10583741","title":"Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon","author_intro":"","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"希伯来语","title":"希伯来语"},{"count":1,"name":"工具书","title":"工具书"}],"origin_title":"","price":"USD 39.99","translator":[],"pages":"1196","publisher":"www.snowballpublishing.com","isbn10":"1607963086","isbn13":"9781607963080","alt_title":"","url":"http:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10583741","author":["Francis Brown","S.
